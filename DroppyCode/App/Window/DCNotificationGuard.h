/// A framework observer can raise while a notification is being posted, and the raise then
/// travels out of the post itself. On macOS 27 the ViewBridge observer of a popover's window
/// ordering raises this way (`-[NSRemoteView containingWindowWillOrderOnScreen:]`, reached from
/// `-[NSWindow _doWindowWillBeVisibleAsSheet:]` posting `NSWindowWillBeVisibleAsSheet`), and
/// because that happens inside a SwiftUI layout pass AppKit's layout block catches the raise and
/// ends the app with `+[NSApplication _crashOnException:]`; the Sept 18 2026 reports from the
/// release-notes cards on Settings > About read exactly so.
///
/// `DCInstallNotificationGuard()` wraps the center's two public post methods, so such a raise is
/// logged (subsystem `iordv.droppycode`, category `notification`) and the post returns: the
/// window ordering and the popover finish their work. It is a net, not the cure: whatever raised
/// has still not seen its notification.
