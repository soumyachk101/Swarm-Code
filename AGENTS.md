# AGENTS.md — SwarmAI agent workflow

## Worktrees (mandatory for coding)

- Never code directly in `/Users/soumyachakraborty/Documents/droppy-code/SwarmAI` (main checkout).
- For every coding task: first create your own worktree, then work there.
- Setup per task:
 1. `git fetch origin --prune`
 2. `git worktree add -b <branch> ~/.swarmai/worktrees/agent-<slug> origin/main`
 (or from the agreed base branch instead of `origin/main`)
 3. Do all edits, builds and `scripts/quick_run.sh` runs inside that worktree.
- Cleanup only when the task is done/merged:
 `git worktree remove --force ~/.swarmai/worktrees/agent-<slug>` + `git worktree prune`.
- Never delete the main checkout, never touch another agent's worktree.

## Relaunching (never unprompted)

- NEVER run `scripts/quick_run.sh` or otherwise quit/relaunch SwarmAI unless explicitly asked for it in that moment.
- Building inside the worktree is fine; installing to /Applications and relaunching is not.
- "Finish", "merge", "done" or "test it" do not imply relaunch — only an explicit request to run/relaunch the app does.

## Merging (always via glab, always squash)

- Project history is already bloated: 4,292 commits on GitLab, mostly tiny
 Hydra head commits plus one merge commit per MR (project `merge_method`
 is `merge`, `squash_option` is `default_off`). Do not let it grow: every
 team merge MUST land as exactly one commit on `main`.
- When asked to "merge", always merge via `glab`: push the branch,
 `glab mr create --squash-before-merge`, `glab mr merge --squash --remove-source-branch`,
 then sync the checkout.
- Never merge without `--squash` (create: `--squash-before-merge`, merge:
 `-s`/`--squash`). Never merge locally into `main` and never push
 straight to `main`.
- Do not rewrite existing history (`rebase -i`, `filter-branch`,
 `filter-repo`, force-push to `main`) to "fix" the 4,292 commits; squash
 applies to new merges only.
