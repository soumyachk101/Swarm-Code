"""Renders the onboarding tour's captures from the real app, then imports them as assets.

The app runs once in its tour capture mode (see DroppyCode/Support/TourCaptures.swift):
it opens the real window with mock data over a curated gradient backdrop, photographs
each tour scene as a 16:10 still into build.noindex/tour-captures, and quits. This
script then resizes every still to exactly 1320x824 and writes it into the tour
imagesets (welcome comes from the web hero, themes from a seamless 2x2 collage).

A still's sidecar may name a `focus`, the part of the scene the page is about (the
open popover with its chip, the team's panel); the page is then cut around that focus
instead of the whole window, so the slider and Hydra pages zoom on their subject.

The website's set is NOT cut here: scripts/website_captures.py encodes the same
tour run whole into build.noindex/website-tour and uploads it to the R2 tour/v2
prefix with per-key verification, so only one uploader writes those keys. With
--website/--export-only/--upload this script delegates to that pipeline. Needs
Pillow (pip).

    scripts/tour_captures.py                 # build, capture, import into the asset catalog
    scripts/tour_captures.py --website       # ...and encode the website's set via website_captures.py
    scripts/tour_captures.py --export-only   # encode the website's set from the last run
    scripts/tour_captures.py --upload        # ...and push it to R2 (wrangler signed in)
