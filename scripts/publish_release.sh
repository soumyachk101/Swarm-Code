# The version is project.yml's MARKETING_VERSION; the disk image defaults to
# the one scripts/release.sh leaves in build.noindex. The notes come from
# ReleaseNotes/<version>.md, written as "## New features", "## Bug fixes" and
# "## Refinements" headings with a bullet per change: the app reads those
# three sections into its cards. Needs gh signed in.
