# Dev loop for Droppy Code: build Debug, install it as the single
# /Applications copy of the dev app, and relaunch it.
#
#   scripts/quick_run.sh
#
# A Debug build is "Droppy Code Dev" (bundle id iordv.droppycode.dev): it runs
# beside the released Droppy Code with its own library, settings, keychain items
# and worktrees (~/.droppy-code-dev), and never touches the release app's. Dev
# keeps its own data across relaunches: pair names, MCP sign-ins and the threads
# made in Dev live only there, and a mirror of the release app would wipe them.
# Set DROPPY_DEV_SYNC=1 to have scripts/sync_dev_data.sh replace Dev's library,
# settings and API keys with the release app's before the relaunch.
#
# Builds under build.noindex (never ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData),
# because the ".noindex" suffix keeps Spotlight and Launchpad from listing
# the build folder as a second copy of the app. There must only ever be one
# dev app: /Applications/Droppy Code Dev.app.
#
# Safe to run from an agent inside Droppy Code itself: quitting the app may
# interrupt the calling session, but this script keeps going and the fresh
# build picks up the new changes on relaunch.
