# Droppy Code

The coding app by [Droppy](https://getdroppy.app). A native macOS app for your coding agents. Written entirely in Swift and SwiftUI with Liquid Glass, for Macs with Apple silicon on macOS 26 and later.

It drives the coding agents you already have installed and signed in, on your own subscriptions:

| Provider | Command line tool | Protocol |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `codex` | app-server JSON-RPC |
| Claude | `claude` | stream-json with permission prompts |
| Cursor | `cursor-agent` | Agent Client Protocol |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | Agent Client Protocol |
| Grok | `grok` | Agent Client Protocol |
| Antigravity | `agy` | stream-json headless |
| Copilot | `copilot` | headless JSON-RPC (the Copilot SDK protocol) |
| Command Code | `cmd` | headless print mode (NDJSON events), one run per turn, with a session mod for approvals |
| Pi | `pi` | RPC mode (JSONL over stdio), one process per thread, with a gate extension for approvals |
| DeepSeek | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` | native API (OpenAI-compatible) |
| Meta | `MODEL_API_KEY` | native API at `api.meta.ai/v1` (Muse Spark) |

## What it does

- Projects and threads in a glass sidebar with search, pinning, settling (or archiving), and drag to resize. A settled thread drops to the bottom, small and grey, until you reopen it.
- Streaming conversations with reasoning, tool calls, plans, to-do lists and errors.
- Approvals and questions from the agent, answered inline.
- Plan mode, model and reasoning selection, and four permission modes per thread.
- Twenty-six tinted-glass themes, from System to Catppuccin, Dracula, Claude and Codex.
- A diff for every turn, captured as hidden git checkpoints, with revert.
- An embedded terminal per thread, plus project scripts from `droppy-code.json`.
- New threads in their own git worktree.
- Commit, push and pull requests, with generated commit messages and thread titles.
- A command palette, keyboard shortcuts and notifications when work finishes.
- Hydra: one chat, many heads. Switch it on and the agent leads a team of helper agents on big jobs: it writes the briefs, sends the heads out in parallel, each in its own copy of the project, and their work lands back in your checkout as one merge. Each head has a floating panel, and a pair sets the lead's model and the heads' model; a pair can cross providers, a strong lead on one and quick heads on another, with one effort slider fused for both.
- A welcome tour on first launch, six pages of real captures; the Help menu opens it again.
- Usage limits and credits: the ring beside the send button opens a popover with the context window, each plan's rolling limits and resets (Codex, Claude, Antigravity, Copilot and Command Code) and the credit left on DeepSeek and Command Code keys; a pair across two providers stacks the lead's over the heads'. A switch in General settings keeps the same in a floating panel beside the chat, and Settings › Providers shows every signed-in account at once.

Remote access, mobile apps, cloud sync, telemetry and a web client are left out on purpose.

## Requirements

- A Mac with Apple silicon running macOS 26 or later
- At least one provider installed and signed in, for example `codex login`, `claude auth login`, `copilot login`, `cmd login` or `pi` (then `/login`)
- Git, plus `gh` or `glab` for pull requests

## Build

```bash
brew install xcodegen
xcodegen generate
open DroppyCode.xcodeproj
```

SwiftTerm, the only dependency, is fetched by Swift Package Manager. Xcode asks once to trust its build plugin.

## Release

`scripts/release.sh` archives an Apple silicon build, signs it with Developer ID, notarizes and staples both the app and a disk image, and checks Gatekeeper. The disk image lands in `build.noindex/`, a folder Spotlight skips.

`scripts/publish_release.sh` then tags the version from `project.yml`, creates the GitLab release with the notes from `ReleaseNotes/<version>.md` (written as `## New features`, `## Bug fixes` and `## Refinements` bullets, which the app's About page reads into its cards) and points the latest-download permalink at the new disk image, which is what Settings › About and the website's download button resolve to.

## Layout

| Folder | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `DroppyCode/App` | App entry, commands, settings and the project library |
| `DroppyCode/Providers` | Codex, Claude, ACP, Antigravity, Copilot, Command Code and Pi adapters behind one event model |
| `DroppyCode/Runtime` | Per-thread state, streaming, checkpoints and rewind |
| `DroppyCode/Git` | Git, worktrees, checkpoints and diff parsing |
| `DroppyCode/Views` | Window chrome, sidebar, timeline, composer, changes, terminal, palette and settings |
| `DroppyCode/Support` | Process I/O, JSON-RPC and the login shell environment |
| `website` | The marketing site, a static page published by Netlify (`netlify.toml`) |
